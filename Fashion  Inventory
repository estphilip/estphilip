##Fashion Stock Flow & Trends Dashboard

###Problem Statement / Business Objective

Fashion retailers often struggle with stockouts and overstock. Products that customers want sell out too fast, while less desirable ones pile up in storage. This leads to missed sales, wasted inventory, and frustrated customers.
This project aims to help fashion businesses:

 Forecast product demand
 Reduce overstock and stockouts
 Align discount strategies with actual buyer behavior
 Understand sales trends across genders and product types

###About the Dataset
Source: Fashion retail product listing from a synthetic/realistic inventory sample.
Size: 15,000+ rows
Key Columns:

   `Product ID`, `Brand`, `Product Type`, `Dominant Material`, `Dominant Color`
   `Size`, `Variant Price`, `Compare at Price`, `Ideal For` (Men/Women/Boys/Girls)
   Custom columns created: `Discount`, `Discount%`, `Stock Flag` (1 = In stock, 0 = Out of Stock, -1 = Unknown)

###Data Cleaning Process

Done in Power BI, Excel, and Python:

1. Standardized Date Formats – Unified date styles for consistency.
2. Removed Visual Formatting – Cleared Excel-based highlights and colors.
3. Filled Missing Data – Used placeholder values like “Unknown Color” to maintain row integrity.
4. Normalized Size Values – Separated text and numeric sizes into separate columns.
5. Created Composite Columns – Combined Date and Time into `DateTime` field.
6. Cleaned Text Columns – Trimmed spaces, corrected casing, and removed symbols.
7. Created Custom Fields – Added `Discount`, `Discount%`, and `Stock Flag`.
8. Removed Duplicates – De-duplicated records using `Product ID`.

Insight: Cleaning is an iterative and strategic task, not just cosmetic. It must align with business questions.

###Exploratory Data Analysis

Performed in Power BI, Python (Pandas, Seaborn), and Excel:

####Key Statistical Tests:

 Correlation Analysis
 Linear Regression
 ANOVA (across gender groups)

####Key Findings:

1. Discount vs Compare Price → Strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.77)
2. Regression Coefficients → Every unit increase in discount boosts compare price by \~1.22 units (p < 0.001)
3. Discount vs Stock Status → Weak correlation (\~0.02), hinting other factors like product appeal matter more

###Dashboard Summary

Built with Power BI, titled Fashion Stock Flow & Trends Dashboard, answering 3 key business questions:

 What sells fast (brand/type/color) vs what doesn’t?
 How do discounts and pricing impact behavior across demographics?
 Can we forecast demand better using color, material, or product trends?

###Visual Highlights:

 Bar Charts for out-of-stock analysis
 Line & Combo Charts to show discount patterns
 Donut Charts for material distribution
 Cards for metrics like average discount, stock levels
 Interactive Filters by demographic (Men, Women, Boys, Girls)

###Insights & Recommendations

 Segmented Discounts Work Better: A blanket discount strategy may not suit all product types.
 Women's Products = Seasonal Peaks: Particularly August–September, often driven by discount events.
 Stock Planning Should Be Demographic-Aware: Consider who the product is for when predicting stock needs.
 Discount ≠ Urgency: High discounts don’t always guarantee quicker stock movement.
###Tools Used

 Power BI – Visualizations and DAX
 Excel – Initial data profiling and transformation
 Python (Pandas) – Statistical tests and exploratory analysis
 GitHub – Documentation and versioning
 Canva (optional) – Used to design dashboard thumbnails (if applicable)
###Lessons Learned

 Clean Data = Better Questions: Business value starts at the cleaning stage.
 Documentation Forces Clarity: Writing this helped clarify what I truly discovered.
 Collaboration Adds Value: Thanks to teammate [@Christopher](#) for feedback during data cleaning stages.
